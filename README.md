Be warned! Here there be spoilers. This is the last thing you should be doing in No Man's Sky, not the first.

## Coming Soon!

Stuff we are working on.

- Route map - track your journey!
- Support for multiple starting points - we will pick the best one for you!
- Profiles for your settings - because we know one galaxy is never enough!

## Troubleshooting

Welcome, Interloper! If you are having trouble finding a route to your favorite destination, there is help. Ask a question on [the BlackHoleSun's discord server](https://discord.blackholesuns.com).

### Site Hangs When I Press Go!

You press _Go!_ and the site gets stuck thinking. If you wait a while (should be less than 10 minutes), it finishes with a route that leaves a lot to be desired.

The "hanging" part of this is a known issue. We're working on a fix.

The terrible awful no-good very bad route happens because there is no good route. In other words, the best route from start to destination is just really long. To fix this, you need to start from a better place.

"How do I do that?" Funny you should ask.

## Finding a Good Start

Because black holes take you long distances _around_ the center but not _towards_ it, your start needs to be about the same distance from the center as your destination.

Specifically, your start should be about 15,000 LY to 30,000 LY further from center than your destination. This should minimize unnecessary extra black hole jumps forward or, worse, hyper-jumps away from center.

Being further away than the ideal will definitely increase the length of your route because ... math.

**Tip:** As you explore the galaxy, set up small bases at 50,000 LY intervals from center. If you do this, a good path is just a teleport away!

For best results:

- Travel bases should be in black hole systems. This gives you an extra (cheap) routing alternative for every base.
- Travel bases that have multiple black holes mapped nearby or are on chains are more effective.
  - Did you know that there are potentially 26 regions with black holes directly adjacent to (most) travel bases? That's a lot of decision points!
- Travel bases should be in systems that are mapped into BlackHoleSuns data. We can't optimize with data we don't have.
- If you are up for it, set up bases every 33K or so from center (3 per 100K). This will give slightly better results than 50K intervals, on average.
- Travel bases can be tiny. I like to make mine just big enough to be uploadable, but that isn't strictly necessary.
  - teleporter
  - landing pad (parts are available at any exchange)
  - a few odds and ends to make it uploadable

## Traveler's Checklist

Before you travel, make sure you've packed the essentials and your travel plans are in order. Here is a list of what you'll need.

- **Hyperspace Starship** (required): A 38x12 S-class explorer or 20x6 exotic maxed out on hyperspace upgrades
  - 2,000 LY jump range minimum recommended (just over 2,900 is possible)
- **Black Hole Starship** (optional): A 32x12 S-class fighter or explorer, technology slots maxed out
  - upgrades in normal inventory slots are damaged by black hole travel, but technology slots are safe
  - alternative is to use a junker
- **16 Glyphs** (required): You can't set a waypoint if you can use a portal
- **A Portal Base** (optional): Really speeds up setting up waypoints - just a teleport away
- **Access to Black Holes** (required): This one should be obvious
- **Freighter** (optional): Highly recommended
- **A Good Start Point** (required): See section above.

## Optimizations

Short on time? Low on fuel? Either way, we've got you covered!

### Time

You can choose a route that is optimized for time. This takes into account incidentals like black hole jumps, teleportation, and trips through a portal.

A time-optimized route may include more fuel-using jumps, but it will be the fastest way to get where you are going.

### Fuel

You can choose a route that is optimized for fuel. Specifically, this will minimize the number of fuel-expending jumps to help conserve you hyper-fuel.

Routes that are optimized for fuel consumption can take considerably longer to travel than the equivalent time-optimized route in some cases.

# How to Travel

Okay, let's assume you know where you are starting from and where you want to go. Now what? If you are still unsure what to do, this list should get you going.

- Teleport to start
- Travel to the black hole (or destination) using hyperdrive
  - If same or adjacent sector, poke around until you find it
  - If longer:
    - Go to space station
    - Teleport to your portal base
    - Set glyphs on portal to target system
    - Travel to target system using portal
    - Set a waypoint now that you have visited the system
    - Portal back to base
    - Teleport back to space station
    - Use waypoint to travel to target using hyperdrive
- If you have arrived at destination, sweet! All done
- Else jump through the black hole (use special black hole starship)
- Repeat
